    addition ideas
        xx make highligting bar and axis hover for mouse
            x highlighting bar all taken care of
            o stuck on the part whereby the text in the axis region lights up gold too.
                x finished this by taking using the index orders for each and instead of "this" using d3.select(this)

        create a brushing effect that adjusts the view
        make button that will remove bar based on click to get more refined graph
        center the heading p element
        make a pretty bar that will display the number of the hovered rectangle

    issues that I'm stuck on
        x trouble with the bottom row of bars not being exactly the same 
           x totally done, problem was with the rounding tilda's that I used in front
