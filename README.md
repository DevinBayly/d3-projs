# d3-projs
These are the files that I have been making/using to assist in learning the D3 js language.

the files that are in the main directory are my own with some ideas generated by other's.

the files that are included in the directory "rel_to_others" come from exercises that I put together from various books that I have been using thus far, and therefore are closely related to other people's code, and I don't claim this work solely as my own.
